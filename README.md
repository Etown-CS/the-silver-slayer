[Elizabethtown College](https://www.etown.edu/) | [Computer Science Department](https://www.etown.edu/schools/school-of-engineering-and-computer-science/computer-science/index.aspx) | [Capstone Project](https://github.com/Etown-CS)

A text-based RPG hosted in a to-be-built cybersecurity lab. The game will feature cybersecurity themes and take place across multiple computers running various operating systems. Players will need to perform cybersecurity tasks and/or attacks in order to progress.

[//]: # (Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team. Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be following your instructions.)

## External Requirements

In order to build this project, you first have to install:

FOR WINDOWS:
-   [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

FOR LINUX:
- GCC

[//]: # (If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup. You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.)

## Setup

[//]: # (Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a database for running your webapp locally.)

## Running

[//]: # (Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.)
